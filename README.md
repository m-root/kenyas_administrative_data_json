#All Kenya's Administrative Unit
This is Kenya's Administrative Unit data-dump that I harvested after developing a web-scrapper. 
I do hope that it will help someone like me in times of need.

It covers all County, Sub-County, Constituency, Ward and well linked by the Object-relational with the various IDs.

It is available in two forms. CSV and JSON.
